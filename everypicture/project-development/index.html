                    <img src="images/1.jpg" alt="a design comp of every picture project" width="700" height="437">
                    <figcaption>Figure 1</figcaption>

                    The main thing I changed in this iteration is the method of interaction. This version includes the image map, which provides the ability for the user to hover over a crochet project and click on it. When the user hovers on a project, its outline will light up as shown in Figure 2. When the user clicks on it, the screen will scroll up/down to the designated section and the background color will change to the color that matches the projectâ€™s color. The image map interaction functions as a navigation where user can easily browse through each project without manually scrolling through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To be consistent, the color change effect also happens when the user manually scrolls up and down throughout each section. This enhances user experience by being consistent and preventing confusion.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/2.jpg" alt="a design comp of every picture project" width="700" height="437">
                    <figcaption>Figure 2</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    As shown in Figure 3, another change that I had is to make the site more responsive. Since the image map is unable to be responsive, I made sure the gap between the text and the image is consistent in different screen sizes on the desktop. This makes the experience equal for different users.
