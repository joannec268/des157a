            <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-02-06">February 06, 2025</time>
            <p>
                After reading the <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">Visual Thinking</a> article, I began to understand how imagery plays a role in learning. Visual Thinking Strategies help learners in diverse subjects, especially those with long paragraphs of text. For instance, in an article discussing the topic of biomimicry and how that can be applied in design, it would be much more useful to provide images such as examples of biomimicry projects. This allows the audience to have the visualization to interpret, expand, and be curious about. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The website that I analyzed is <a href="https://www.saapro.ae/">Saapro</a>, a website about waste disposal and sustainability. This website is strong in utilizing graphics, images, and interactive animations that represent nature because these increase engagement and give a sense that the theme of the website is about sustainability. A drawback of the images is that I paid more attention to the images than the texts. For instance, the title is covered by the image and there is a line of words that has a similar color as the graphic which makes it hard to read.

            <h2>Modal Design Research</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-01-29">January 29, 2025</time>
            <p>
                After reading <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">“Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows”</a> by Naema Baskanderi, I learned many rules for designing modals. I am glad to read about this before coding my Madlibs project because I was going to use a modal to show errors to the user and the reading emphasized to not do this for best practice as the “top highlight”.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I realized an error that I often make for my designs where I place modals right in the middle of the screen. However, the reading highlighted that modals should be placed in the upper half of the screen. I sometimes also oversize my modals and I learned that this would lower the accessibility especially in the mobile screens.
            </p>
            <p>
                An interesting term that I learned from the reading is “toast”, a time-based, non-modal UI that is usually placed at the top of the screen. I remember using this for a mobile app design to provide feedback for my user after they successfully did something.

            <h2>Form Design Research</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-01-19">January 19, 2025</time>
            <p>
                As a designer, I realized how many mistakes I have made in previous projects that involved form design after reading "<a href=https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f>Best Practices for Form Design</a>" by Salim Ansari. One example is the habit of focusing on symmetric input field size and neglecting the usability of it. The example from the reading is matching the width of the input field of an email input and zip code input, where they are highly different in character length. Now I understand that by overly focusing on symmetry, we can neglect the usability of the design where users may be confused about their input whether they had typed enough characters. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving from a designer to a user’s perspective, I understand how important the visualization of steps is in the process of filling out a form. When I encounter a long form like filing the FAFSA, I tend to get bored and tired of the process. However, the ability to see how far I am in the form and what step I am helps me complete the form. While filling out a form, I like to set a goal to take a break after I finish a certain step, so I am sure that I have completed that section when I am back from my break.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/signup?forward_url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2F">Spotify</a> sign up process follows the best practices. For instance, for entering the email, the label is located above the input field, there is an inline label that shows the format of entering an email, and when the user enters an invalid email there would be an explanation of what is wrong and provides an example.
